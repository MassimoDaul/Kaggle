# Config textblob, nltk, tensorflow

Textblob and nltk:

    pip3 install nltk
    pip3 install textblob
    
    /Applications/Python 3.6/Install Certificates.command
    
    # SSL doesn't trust the punkt resources, so we have to manually update it
    
    nltk.download()
    
    # Should open up window and you can choose what to download. Grab all of it.
    
    python3 -m textblob.download_corpora
    
    nltk.download('punkt')
    
Tensorflow:

This manually grabs the right version for our 3.6 interpreter.

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0-py3-none-any.whl
